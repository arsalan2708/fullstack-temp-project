# fullstack-temp-project
Havent decided what this project would be about in its entirety just yet. But will be using this as a project to learn react-native+typescript for frontend and learning go lang as the backend programming language. Along with that i will be implementing CI/CD workflows within the development. This project would probably be a notes app that stores the notes locally as markdown, A TUI built using goLang "Huh?" library.
